        <div class="recipe-section">
            <h2>Grass-Fed Filet Mignon Steak:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 grass-fed filet mignon steaks (6-8 ounces each)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons grass-fed ghee</li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Season the filet mignon steaks generously with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of grass-fed ghee over medium-high heat. When the ghee is hot, add the steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, adjusting the time based on your desired level of doneness. Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.

        <!-- Salad Recipe Section -->
        <div class="recipe-section">
            <h2>Kale, Fig, and Green Onion Salad:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4-6 large kale leaves, stems removed and leaves thinly sliced</li>
                <li>4-6 ripe figs, quartered</li>
                <li>4 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the thinly sliced kale, quartered figs, and sliced green onions. In a small bowl, whisk together the extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper to create the dressing. Drizzle the dressing over the kale, figs, and green onions in the mixing bowl. Toss the salad gently to coat the ingredients evenly with the dressing.

                <li>2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons grass-fed ghee</li>

                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Place the sweet potato cubes in a large pot of boiling water and cook until they are fork-tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the sweet potatoes and return them to the pot. Add 1 tablespoon of grass-fed ghee, ground cinnamon, salt, and pepper to taste. Mash the sweet potatoes until they are smooth and well combined. Keep warm.
